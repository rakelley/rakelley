# About Me

My name is Ryan Kelley and I currently live in Illinois, though I was born in
and lived most of my life in Texas.

I am neither a ninja nor a rockstar nor a wizard. I do, however, love to
code, and hope to spend the rest of my working years coding.  I was the kind of
kid who loved doing math proofs and logic puzzles for fun when I didn't have my
nose in a book, and coding as a mathematical language feels like more of that.

More importantly, coding is creative.  Even maintenance and refactoring allows
for moments of insight and expressive elegance in a way I find incredibly
rewarding.  For a number of years I worked in IT, and it felt like constantly
putting out fires, where the best case was that nothing bad was happening at the
moment. Coding on the other hand is unexpectedly beautiful even when it is
routine, and problem solving broken code provides opportunities to improve and
beautify, rather than merely returning things to the status quo.

When I'm not coding, I'm still mostly a reader, though my tastes have graduated
from bad sci-fi to bad sci-fi AND bad fantasy and historical fiction.  I also 
love ciders and spiced beers and an odd assortment of music ranging from west
coast indie rock to vaporwave and witch house.  For a couple years I was active
in the sport of strongman, and hope to get back into that soon.
