# About Me

My name is Ryan Kelley and I currently live in Illinois, though I was born in
and lived most of my life in Texas.

I am neither a ninja nor a rockstar nor a wizard. I have deep reservations about
startup culture, brogrammers, and capitalism in general. I do, however, love to
code, and hope to spend the rest of my working years coding.  I was the kind of
kid who loved doing math proofs and logic puzzles for fun when I didn't have my
nose in a book, and coding as a mathematical language feels like more of that.

More importantly, coding is creative.  Even maintenance and refactoring allows
for moments of insight and expressive elegance in a way I find incredibly
rewarding.  For a number of years I worked in IT, and I found it a dreadful
sisyphean grind of fixing failing hardware and user-induced problems. Coding on
the other hand is unexpectedly beautiful even when it is routine, and problem
solving broken code provides opportunities to improve and beautify, rather than
merely returning things to the status quo.

When I'm not coding, I'm still mostly a reader, though my tastes have graduated
from bad sci-fi to bad sci-fi AND bad fantasy and historical fiction.  I also 
love ciders and spiced beers and an odd assortment of music ranging from west
coast indie rock to vaporwave and witch house.  For a couple years I was active
in the sport of strongman, and hope to get back into that soon.
