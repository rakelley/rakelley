## Project Status: In Progress


### Github: [https://github.com/rakelley/rakelley](https://github.com/rakelley/rakelley)


### Overview
This site is a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application serving
Markdown views and HAML layouts using Nginx + Unicorn.  It's an incredibly
simple and lightweight stack that really works well for microsites like this
one.


### Project Details
I've done an extensive write-up
[here](/posts/2015/06/03/deploying-sinatra-microsites-with-git) on the server
stack.  Application-wise it uses Markdown for all content with automatic
detection of newly added blog posts.  It's lovely being able to do so much in
so few lines with Sinatra.


### Post-Mortem
Though I haven't gotten to work with it nearly as much as I'd like, I'm a big
fan of Ruby's elegance, and tools like Sinatra make it even better.
