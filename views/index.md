# Coding The Hard Way

I've been intrigued by code since my first attempts with QBASIC as a kid, but
never had a chance to develop that interest professionally until 2011.  Since
then I've been reading, poking, learning, and generally doing everything the
hard way at least three times, but it has only sucked me further in.

This site is here to show off some of my past and present projects and what I
hope to do in future.
